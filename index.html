		<h2>Spicy Vodka Pasta</h2>
		<p>Spicy vodka pasta is a creamy, restaurant-style dish featuring al dente pasta tossed in a silky tomato and cream sauce enriched with a splash of vodka and a warming chili kick for heat. It&rsquo;s indulgent yet simple, with a rich, velvety texture and a balanced flavor that&rsquo;s both tangy and slightly spicy, making it a favorite for date nights, dinner parties, and cozy weeknight meals alike.</p>

			<li>&frac12;cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<ol>
			<li>  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the Italian sausage, breaking apart with a spatula until well-browned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
			<li>  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Be sure to save one cup pasta cooking liquid before you drain the pasta. I like to use a liquid measuring cup to scoop out one cup during the last minute of cooking.</li>
			<li>In the same skillet you cooked the sausage, add the olive over medium heat. Add the minced shallot and garlic and saut&eacute; until softened and fragrant, about 4-5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and stir. Deglaze the pan with the vodka, letting it sizzle out while scraping up the browned bits at the bottom of the skillet.
			Stir in the cream, parmesan and butter until well-combined. Add the cooked pasta and sausage to the sauce and pour in the reserved cup pasta water. You can start conservatively with one-half cup and add a little water as needed until the sauce is glossy and coats the pasta.</li>
			<li>Add pasta to serving bowls or plates and garnish with parmesan, cracked pepper and basil. Serve with a side salad or steamed or roasted veggies for a balanced meal.</li>
